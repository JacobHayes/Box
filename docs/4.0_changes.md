# Box 4.0 Features and Changes

Box 4.0 has brought a lot of great new features, but also some breaking changes. They are documented here to help you upgrade. 

To install the latest 4.x you will need at least Python 3.6 (or current supported python 3.x version)

```shell script
pip install --upgrade python-box>=4
```


If your application is no longer working, and need a quick fix: 

```shell script
pip install --upgrade python-box<4
```


## Dot notation access by keys!

Enabled with `box_dots=True`. 

```python
from box import Box
my_box = Box(a={'b': {'c': {'d': 'my_value'}}}, box_dots=True)
print(my_box['a.b.c.d'])
# 'my_value'
my_box['a.b.c.d'] = 'test'
# <Box: {'a': {'b': {'c': {'d': 'test'}}}}>
del my_box['a.b.c.d']
# <Box: {'a': {'b': {'c': {}}}}>
```


## Adding merge_update as its own function, update now works like the default dictionary update

Traditional update is destructive to nested dictionaries. 

```python
from box import Box
box_one = Box(inside_dict={'data': 5})
box_two = Box(inside_dict={'folly': True})
box_one.update(box_two)
repr(box_one)
# <Box: {'inside_dict': {'folly': True}}>
```

Merge update takes existing sub dictionaries into consideration 

```python
from box import Box
box_one = Box(inside_dict={'data': 5})
box_two = Box(inside_dict={'folly': True})
box_one.merge_update(box_two)
repr(box_one)
"<Box: {'inside_dict': {'data': 5, 'folly': True}}>"
```


## Support for adding two Boxes together

```python
from box import Box
Box(a=4) + Box(a='overwritten', b=5)
# <Box: {'a': 'overwritten', 'b': 5}>
```

## No more Python 2 support

Python 2 is soon officially EOL and Box 4 won't support it in anyway. Box 3 will not be updated, other than will consider PRs for bugs or security issues.

## Removing Ordered Box

As dictionaries are ordered by default in Python 3.6+ there is no point to continue writing and testing code outside of that. 

## Removing `BoxObject`

As BoxObject was not cross platform compatible and had some [issues](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/issues/132) it has been removed. 

## Removing `box_it_up`
