# Box 4.0 Features and Changes

Box 4.0 has brought a lot of great new features, but also some breaking changes. They are documented here to help you upgrade. 


## Dot notation access by keys!

Enabled with `box_dots=True`. 

```python
from box import Box
my_box = Box(a={'b': {'c': {'d': 'my_value'}}}, box_dots=True)
print(my_box['a.b.c.d'])
# 'my_value'
my_box['a.b.c.d'] = 'test'
# <Box: {'a': {'b': {'c': {'d': 'test'}}}}>
del my_box['a.b.c.d']
# <Box: {'a': {'b': {'c': {}}}}>
```


## Adding merge_update as its own function, update now works like the default dictionary update



## Support for adding two Boxes together

```python
from box import Box
Box(a=4) + Box(a='overwritten', b=5)
# <Box: {'a': 'overwritten', 'b': 5}>
```

## No more Python 2 support

Python 2 is soon officially EOL and Box 4 won't support it in anyway. Box 3 will not be updated, other than will consider PRs for bugs or security issues.

## Removing Ordered Box

As dictionaries are ordered by default in Python 3.6+ there is no point to continue writing and testing code outside of that. 

## Removing `BoxObject`

As BoxObject was not cross platform compatible and had some [issues](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/issues/132) it has been removed. 

## Removing `box_it_up`
